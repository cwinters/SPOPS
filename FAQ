SPOPS FAQ

I'm trying to use multiple property values but when I try to do
something like:

  print join( ', ', @{ $object->{myproperty} } ), "\n";

I get an error like:

  Can't use string ("top") as an ARRAY ref while "strict refs" in use
  at ...

AAAAAAAAAA

You need to tell SPOPS that the property supports multiple values. In
your configuration, define:

    multivalue => [ 'myproperty' ],

and you should be set.

When running the DBI SPOPS tests with Postgres, I get:

  NOTICE: CREATE TABLE/PRIMARY KEY will create implicit index
  'spops_test_pkey' for table 'spops_test'

Can I turn this off?

AAAAAAAAAA

This is a 'feature' of the Postgres client library that is passed
along by DBD::Pg. Nothing we can do.
