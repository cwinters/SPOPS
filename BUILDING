BUILDING SPOPS FROM CVS
========================================

This document contains instructions for building SPOPS from CVS
sources.

The only thing to worry about is the SPOPS manual, which is run
through the Template Toolkit before being put into the right place. If
you do not run the 'build_docs' script you'll get a bunch of messages
from 'perl Makefile.PL' that 'SPOPS/Manual...' files are missing.

To build these first, first make sure you have the Template Toolkit
installed, then run './build_docs' from the root of the SPOPS source.

 $ ./build_docs

That's it!
