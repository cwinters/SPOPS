Process:

 - Put discussion and extended examples in separate doc modules. Module
 documentation should be restricted to method specifics and one or two
 examples.

  - How are objects cached? (Move to separate section?)

  - How can I create my own serialization class?


SPOPS::Manual::ObjectRules

  - What are general SPOPS behaviors?

  - Discuss rulesets and how they work, give examples.

  - How can I implement a ruleset?


SPOPS::Manual::Datasources

  - What is a datasource?

  - How can I make a datasource available to all my objects?

  - How do I use multiple datasources?


SPOPS::Manual::Security

  - How does SPOPS security work?
