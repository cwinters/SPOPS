HOWTO Add a New DBI Database to SPOPS
=========================

This document explains how to add support for a new DBI-supported
database in SPOPS.


Introduction
---------------

There are lots and lots of databases supported by DBI, and we'd like
as many of them as possible to be supported by SPOPS. Fortunately, DBI
and the DBD drivers do most of the difficult work for us. In fact, you
can probably use many databases supported by DBI with no effort at all.

This document is for when you can't, or for when you need
functionality not provided in the stock SPOPS::DBI module.


The Files
---------------

Here are the files you should be concerned with:

 SPOPS/DBI.pm

   - Object serialization functionality

 SPOPS/SQLInterface.pm

   - Database interaction

 SPOPS/Key/DBI/*.pm

   - Generate primary keys


The Issues
---------------

When porting from one database to another, there are a few general
issues to worry about:

 (1) Naming conventions: does a naming convention in one database
 violate the convention in another?

 (2) Datatypes:

 (3) Auto-generating primary keys:

 (4) Differing functionality:

If your database does not have a method for generating primary keys,
then you probably don't need to do anything at all. The main areas
where we need DBD-specific code are in SPOPS::SQLInterface, and as
long as your database supports the {Name} attribute of the database
handle and the {TYPE} and {NAME} attributes of a statement handle, you
shouldn't need to do anything.
