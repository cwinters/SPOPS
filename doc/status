SPOPS::Manual

 - Pretty much done. If we add further sections to the manual we'll
 have to put a pointer here, but other than that...

 - More overview -- maybe as an example walk through a single request
 in pseudocode?

 - Put the ASCII-art in better context, although it's mostly there.

SPOPS::Manual::ObjectRules

 - More examples -- ALL kinds of stuff
